The **Automatic Gate System using an LCD Display** is designed to enhance security and automation by controlling a gate based on distance measurements from an ultrasonic sensor. When an object is detected within 100 cm, the system activates a red LED, buzzer, and motor to close the gate while displaying "CLOSE" on the LCD. If the area is clear, a green LED lights up, the buzzer and motor turn off, and the LCD displays "OPEN," ensuring a smooth and automated gate operation.
